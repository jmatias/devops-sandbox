# Evidence Vault API Documentation

The Evidence Vault tracks SDLC activities for traceability and auditability of engineering practices.

## üìò Evidence Vault ‚Äì SDLC Traceability Example

This document illustrates the end-to-end software development lifecycle (SDLC) traceability for a canonical Jira story `PROJECT-5000`.

Each step includes metadata such as test IDs, test results, commit hashes, reviewers, ServiceNow CRs, and links to evidence blob IDs and file URLs.

## üîÅ SDLC Workflow Overview

The Evidence Vault captures artifacts at each stage of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) for traceability and audit purposes. Here‚Äôs how the domain model maps to the SDLC:

| **Stage** | **Artifact / Domain Model** | **Endpoint(s)** |
|-----------|-----------------------------|------------------|
| A Jira story is created and assigned to a sprint & release | `UserStory` | `POST /user-story` |
| Developer begins coding and creates a feature branch | (Captured in `branch_from` in `CodeReview`) | `POST /code-review` |
| Developer runs local unit & integration tests | `TestResult` | `POST /test-result` |
| PR is opened for dev ‚Üí peer-reviewed and approved | `CodeReview` + `EvidenceBlob` | `POST /code-review`, `POST /evidence` |
| CI runs unit tests on merged code | `TestResult` | `POST /test-result` |
| Code is deployed to DEV environment | `Deployment` | `POST /deployment` |
| CI runs integration tests in DEV | `TestResult` | `POST /test-result` |
| PR is opened for dev ‚Üí main | `CodeReview` | `POST /code-review` |
| CI runs PREQ tests post-merge | `TestResult` | `POST /test-result` |
| Code is deployed to PREQ | `Deployment` | `POST /deployment` |
| SNOW Change Request is created for QA | `Approval` | `POST /approval` |
| QA CR is approved | `Approval` + `EvidenceBlob` | `POST /approval`, `POST /evidence` |
| Code is deployed to QA | `Deployment` | `POST /deployment` |
| Integration tests run in QA | `TestResult` | `POST /test-result` |
| SNOW CR is created and approved for PROD | `Approval` + `EvidenceBlob` | `POST /approval`, `POST /evidence` |
| Code is deployed to PROD | `Deployment` | `POST /deployment` |
| Integration tests run in PROD | `TestResult` | `POST /test-result` |
| End-to-end traceability is audited | Composite of all above | `GET /traceability/story/{story_id}` |
